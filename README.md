# Tulga-Renderer
Draws 3D objects from certain angles. (Obj Files)

There is no depth perception in the code. You can use just two axis like x and y, x and z, y and z.
You can test the code with your obj files. But i do not guarantee the best result.

You can see results as images in Test Results file.
